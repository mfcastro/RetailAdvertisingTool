This calendar uses Google Calendar API to get the information for a google calendar. I used [FullCalender](http://fullcalendar.io/) to display a calender where I put my google caleder events on.

This shows the image description along with a picture of the image. This information is pulled from Salesforce. An optional **Order** pops up when the sample is not in house and needs to be ordered. The **Order** button redirects the user to the *Vendor Email Form*. 

###### Sample Managment Vendor Email Form
![Screen Shot](https://github.com/mfcastro/RetailAdvertisingTool/blob/master/Screenshots/Email%20contact%20form.PNG)
This form pulls in Vendor Emails from Salesforce. It then sends a HTML email to vendor with the item information that was selected from the dropdown. The items that are shown in the dropdown are all the items that the user does not have in house. 

######Example of Vendor Email Message

This a the sample email that is sent the the Vendor email that is pulled from Salesforce. The email shows who sent the message and their email address to reach them. I shows in bold what item was requested. It also shows the additional comments that the user wrote.
